locations throughout the world.

Our Father in Heaven,
we bow our heads tonight

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
as we've gathered
as Thy sons to learn

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
how to be better brothers
to each other in our service

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and in our quorums
and to learn how

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to bless Thy daughters with whom
we've been privileged to serve

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and to have be part
of our families.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
We're grateful to come and be
taught at the feet of those who

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Thou hast designated to
hold the keys of this work

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
in these latter
days, to be taught

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
in the doctrine of this
order, this holy order,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:90%
after the order of Thy Son.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And to this end, we
ask for Thy Spirit

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to be with us, that we can
learn, that we can be taught,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that those who speak and teach
and instruct can be blessed

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and inspired to the end
that we can become what

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Thou wouldst have us become, in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

The choir will now favor
us with "Love at Home."

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
After the singing, we will
hear from Elder Jeffrey R.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Holland of the Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
He will be followed by
Elder LeGrand R. Curtis

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:90%

Thank you, brethren, for that
beautiful, beautiful hymn.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Not long ago a single sister,
whom I will call Molly,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
came home from work only
to find two inches of water

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
covering her entire
basement floor.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Immediately she realized that
her neighbors, with whom she

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:84%
shared drainage lines, must
have done an inordinate amount

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of laundry and bathing because
she got the backed-up water.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
After calling a friend
to come and help,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
the two began
bailing and mopping.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Just then the doorbell rang.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Her friend cried out,
"It's your home teachers!"

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Molly laughed.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
"It is the last day of
the month," she replied--

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
--"but I can assure you it
is not my home teachers."

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
With bare feet, wet trousers,
hair up in a bandana,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and a very fashionable
pair of latex gloves,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Molly made her way to the door.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But her stark appearance did
not compare with the stark sight

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:90%
standing before her eyes.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
It was her home teachers!

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
"You could have knocked me
over with a plumber's friend!"

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:90%
she later told me.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
"This was a home teaching
miracle--the kind the Brethren

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
share in general
conference talks!"

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:84%
She went on: "But
just as I was trying

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to decide whether to give them
a kiss or hand them a mop,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
they said, 'Oh,
Molly, we are sorry.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:90%
We can see you are busy.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to intrude;
we'll come another time.'"

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:90%
"And they were gone."

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
"Who was it?" her friend
called out from the basement.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
"I wanted to say, 'It
certainly wasn't the Three

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Nephites,'" Molly admitted, "but
I restrained myself and said

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
very calmly, 'It was
my home teachers,

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
but they felt this was not
an opportune time to leave

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:90%
their message.'"

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, may we briefly
examine the priesthood duty

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
that has been described as "the
Church's first source of help"

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:90%
to its individuals and families.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Entire forests have
been sacrificed

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
providing the paper to organize
it and then reorganize it.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
A thousand pep talks have been
given trying to encourage it.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Certainly no Freudian
travel agency anywhere

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
could possibly arrange
the number of guilt trips

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:90%
this subject has provoked.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet still we struggle
to achieve anywhere

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
near an acceptable
standard of performance

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
regarding the Lord's
commandment to "watch over

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
the church always" through
priesthood home teaching.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Part of the challenge we face
is the changing demographics

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
of the Church.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
With our membership now spread
across more than 30,000 wards

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and branches located in some
188 nations and territories,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
it's much more challenging to
visit the homes of our brothers

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and sisters than it was in
the early days of the Church

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
when neighbor taught
neighbor in something

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:90%
called "block teaching."

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, in many
units of the Church,

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
there is a limited number of
available priesthood bearers

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
to do home teaching, leaving
those who can serve with

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
as many as 18 or 20
families--or more--to care for.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
There can also be issues of
long distances to travel,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
the high cost and low
availability of transportation,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and the extended length of the
local workday and workweek.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Add to these some cultural
taboos against uninvited home

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
visits and the safety
issues that exist in many

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
of the world's
neighborhoods--well,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see the
complexity of the problem.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, in the
best of all worlds

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and in those circumstances
where it can be,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a monthly visit in each
home is still the ideal

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:90%
the Church will strive for.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But realizing that in many
locations around the world

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
achieving such an ideal is
not possible and that we cause

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:84%
those brethren to feel like
failures when we ask them to do

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
what cannot
realistically be done,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
the First Presidency wrote
to the priesthood leaders

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Church in December of
2001 giving this inspired,

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
very helpful counsel: "There are
some locations in the Church,"

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:90%
they wrote, "where ...

of insufficient numbers

of active priesthood brethren
and various other local

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
challenges."

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned some of them.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
"When such circumstances
prevail," they go on,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
"leaders should do
their best to use

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
the resources they have
available to watch over

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and strengthen each member."

my ward or branch

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%

circumstances, my Aaronic

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%

apply the First Presidency's

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
counsel (which is
now handbook policy)

in something like this way:
First, however many months

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
it took to achieve it, we would
pursue the scriptural mandate

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to "visit the house of
each member," establishing

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
a schedule that would get us
to those homes on a calendar

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that was both possible
and practical.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Built into that schedule
would be the prioritization

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of our available time and
frequency of contacts to those

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:84%
who needed us the
most--investigators

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the missionaries are teaching,
newly baptized converts,

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
those who are ill, the
lonely, the less active,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
single-parent families with
children still at home,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
While working
through our schedule

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to visit all homes, which may
take some months to accomplish,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
we would make other
kinds of contact

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
with the individuals
and families

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:84%
on our list via any of the
means the Lord has provided.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Certainly we would watch
for our families at Church

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and, as the scripture
says, would "speak one

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with another concerning the
welfare of their souls."

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we'd
make phone calls,

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
send emails and text
messages, even tap out

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
a greeting through one of the
many forms of social media

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
available to us.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
To help address
special needs, we

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
might send a scriptural
quote or a line

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
from a general conference
talk or a Mormon

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Message drawn from the wealth
of material on LDS.org.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In the language of
the First Presidency,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
we would do the best we
could in the circumstances

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
we faced with the
resources available to us.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, the appeal
I am making tonight

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is for you to lift your
vision of home teaching.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Please, in newer, better ways,
see yourselves as emissaries

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:90%
of the Lord to His children.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
That means leaving behind
the tradition of a frantic,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
law of Moses-like,
end-of-the-month calendar

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in which you rush to give a
scripted message from a Church

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
magazine that the
family has already read.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
We would hope, rather,
that you will establish

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
an era of genuine,
gospel-oriented concern

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
for each member,
each individual,

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
watching over and
caring for each other,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
addressing spiritual and
temporal needs in any way that

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
helps.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, as for what "counts"
as home teaching, everything

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
counts, every good thing you
do "counts," so report it all!

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the report
that matters most

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is how you have
blessed and cared

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
for those within your
stewardship, which

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
has virtually nothing to
do with a specific calendar

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
or a particular location.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that
you love your people

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and are fulfilling the
commandment to "watch over

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:90%
the church always."

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:84%
On May 30 of last year,
my friend Troy Russell

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
pulled his pickup truck
slowly out of his garage

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
on his way to donate goods to
the local Deseret Industries.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
He felt his back tire
roll over a bump.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Thinking some item had
fallen off the truck,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
he got out only to find his
precious nine-year-old son

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Austen lying face
down on the pavement.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The screams, the priesthood
blessing, the paramedic crew,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the hospital staff--they were,
in this case, to no avail.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Austen was gone.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:90%

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Unable to sleep, unable to find
peace, Troy was inconsolable.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
He said it was more
than he could bear

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and that he simply
could not go on.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:90%

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But into that agonizing breach
came three redeeming forces.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
First was the love
and reassuring spirit

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
of our Father in Heaven,
a presence communicated

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
through the Holy Ghost that
comforted Troy, taught him,

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
loved him, whispered that God
knows everything about losing

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful and perfect Son.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Second was his wife, Deedra,
who held Troy in her arms

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and loved him and reminded him
that she too had lost that son

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and she was determined not
to lose a husband also.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Third in this story is
John Manning, home teacher

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
extraordinaire.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I frankly don't know
on what schedule John

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and his junior companion made
visits to the Russell home,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
or what message was given
when they got there,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or how they reported
the experience.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is that last
spring Brother Manning reached

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
down and picked Troy
Russell up off the tragedy

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of that driveway just as if he
were picking up little Austen

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Like the home teacher
or watchman or brother

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
in the gospel he
was supposed to be,

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
John simply took over
the priesthood care

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:90%
and keeping of Troy Russell.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
He started by saying,
"Troy, Austen wants you back

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
on your feet--including on the
basketball court--so I will be

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:90%
here every morning at 5:15 a.m.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Be ready because I don't want
to have to come in and get you

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
up--and I know Deedra doesn't
want me to do that either."

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:84%
"I didn't want to go,"
Troy told me later,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
"because I had always
taken Austen with me

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
on those mornings and
I knew the memories

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
would be just too painful.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
But John insisted, so I went.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
From that first day back, we
talked--or rather I talked

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and John listened.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I talked the entire
drive to the church

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and then the entire drive home.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I talked while
we parked in the driveway

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and watched the sun
rise over Las Vegas.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
At first it was difficult,
but over time I realized I had

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
found my strength in the form
of a very slow 6'2" Church ball

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
player with an absolutely
pathetic jump shot,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
but who loved me and listened
to me until the sun finally rose

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:90%
again on my life."

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
My brethren of the
holy priesthood,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
when we speak of home teaching
or watchcare or personal

00:26:54.170 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
priesthood ministry--call it
what you will--this is what we

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:90%
are talking about.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:84%
We are asking you,
as home teachers,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
to be God's emissaries to His
children, to love and care

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and pray for the people you are
assigned, as we love and care

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and pray for you.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
May you be vigilant in tending
the flock of God in ways

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
consistent with your
circumstances, I pray,

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
in the name of the Good Shepherd
of us all, whose witness I am,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
even the Lord
Jesus Christ, amen.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:90%

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
On June 14, 1989, due
to some misinformation

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
about the Church, the
government of Ghana

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
banned all activities
of The Church

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
within that African country.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The government seized
all Church property,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and all missionary
activity stopped.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The members of the Church,
who refer to this period

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
as "the freeze," did their
best to live the gospel

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
without branch meetings or
the support of missionaries.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
There are many inspiring stories
about how the members kept

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:84%
the light of the gospel shining
by worshipping in their homes

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and looking after each other
as home and visiting teachers.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the
misunderstanding was resolved,

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and on November 29, 1990, the
freeze ended and normal Church

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:90%
activities resumed.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Since then there have been
excellent relationships

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
between the Church and
the government of Ghana.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Members who lived
through the freeze

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
are quick to point
out the blessings that

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
came from that unusual period.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The faith of many
was strengthened

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
through the adversity
that they faced.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But one blessing of the
freeze came in an unusual way.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Ofosu-Hene
was a young policeman

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:84%
assigned to guard an LDS
meetinghouse during the freeze.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:84%
His duty was to watch over
the building at night.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
When Nicholas first arrived
at the meetinghouse,

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
he saw that things had
been scattered around,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
with papers, books, and
furniture in disarray.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of the
disorder, he saw

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:90%
a copy of the Book of Mormon.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
He tried ignoring
the book because he

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:90%
had been told it was evil.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But he felt strangely
attracted to it.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Nicholas could
ignore the book no longer.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:90%
He picked it up.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He felt impelled to
start reading it.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.380 align:middle line:84%
He read through the
night, tears running down

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:90%
his cheeks as he read.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The first time he picked it
up, he read all of 1 Nephi.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The second time, he
read all of 2 Nephi.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
When he got to 2 Nephi chapter
25, he read the following:

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.530 align:middle line:84%
"And we talk of Christ,
we rejoice in Christ,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
we preach of Christ,
we prophesy of Christ,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and we write according
to our prophecies,

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that our children may know
to what source they may look

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:90%
for a remission of their sins."

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
At that point, Nicholas
felt the Spirit

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.220 align:middle line:84%
so strongly that
he started sobbing.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
He realized that in the
course of his reading

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
he had received several
spiritual promptings

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that this book was
scripture, the most correct

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:90%
he had ever read.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the
Latter-day Saints,

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
contrary to what he
had heard, strongly

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:90%
believe in Jesus Christ.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
After the freeze ended and
missionaries returned to Ghana,

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas, his wife, and his
children joined the Church.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
When I saw him last year,
he was a police commander

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and was serving as the
president of the Tamale Ghana

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:90%
District of the Church.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:84%
He says: "The Church has
transformed my life. ...

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I thank the Almighty God for
leading me into this gospel."

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Alibert Davies,
another Ghanaian,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:84%
accompanied a friend to
one of our meetinghouses,

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
where the friend had
a presidency meeting.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
While he waited for
his friend, Alibert

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
read a book he found nearby.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
When the meeting ended, Alibert
wanted to take the book home.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He was given permission not
only to take that book but also

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:90%
a copy of the Book of Mormon.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
When he got home, he started
reading the Book of Mormon.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:90%
He could not put it down.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He read by candlelight
until 3:00 a.m.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
He did that for several nights,
overwhelmed by what he read

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and what he felt. Alibert is
now a member of the Church.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Angelo Scarpulla started
his theological studies

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
in his native Italy
when he was 10.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
He eventually became a
priest and served his church

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:90%
with devotion.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point his
faith started to waver,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and he sought and
received opportunities

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:90%
for further study.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The more he studied, however,
the more concerned he became.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
What he read and
felt convinced him

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that there had been
a general apostasy

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
from the true doctrine taught
by Jesus and the early Apostles.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Angelo searched for God's true
religion in various faiths

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
but was left unsatisfied
for many years.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
One day he encountered
two members of the Church

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
who were helping the
missionaries find more people

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
to teach.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He felt drawn to them
and joyfully listened

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:90%
to their message.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Angelo willingly accepted a
copy of the Book of Mormon.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
That evening he started
reading the book.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:90%
He felt overcome with joy.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Through the Spirit, God gave
Angelo an inner assurance

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that in the Book
of Mormon he would

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
find the truth for which he had
been seeking for many years.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Sweet feelings
flooded through him.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
What he read and what he
learned from the missionaries

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
confirmed his
conclusion that there

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
had been a general
apostasy, but he also

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
learned that God's true Church
had been restored to the earth.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
A short while later, Angelo
was baptized into the Church.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:84%
When I first met him, he was the
president of the Rimini Italy

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Branch of our Church.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
What Nicholas,
Alibert, and Angelo

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:84%
experienced with
the Book of Mormon

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
is reminiscent of Parley
P. Pratt's experience:

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:84%
"I opened [the] book
with eagerness. ...

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I read all day," he wrote.
"Eating was a burden,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I had no desire for food;
sleep was a burden when ...

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:84%
night came, for I
preferred reading to sleep.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
"As I read, the spirit
of the Lord was upon me,

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and I knew and comprehended
that the book was

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
true, as plainly and manifestly
as a man comprehends and knows

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:90%
that he exists.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:90%
My joy was ...

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.940 align:middle line:84%
full, as it were, and I rejoiced
sufficiently to more than pay

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:84%
me for all the sorrows,
sacrifices and toils

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:90%
of my life."

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people have such
powerful experience

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:84%
with the Book of Mormon the
first time they open it,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
but for others the witness
of the truthfulness

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.890 align:middle line:84%
comes more gradually as
they read and pray about it.

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.390 align:middle line:90%
That was my case.

00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I first read the Book of Mormon
as a teenage seminary student.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the copy of the
Book of Mormon I read.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you the exact
time or place that it happened,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.680 align:middle line:84%
but somewhere
during that reading,

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I started sensing something.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a warmth
and a spirit that came

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.180 align:middle line:90%
every time I opened the book.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
The feeling grew as I
continued my reading.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.890 align:middle line:84%
That feeling
continues to this day.

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Every time I open
the Book of Mormon,

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:84%
it's like turning on a
switch--the Spirit flows

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:90%
into my heart and soul.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
For yet others, a testimony
of the Book of Mormon

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:84%
comes more slowly, after
much study and prayer.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who read
the Book of Mormon searching

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.140 align:middle line:90%
to know if it was true.

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:84%
He applied the
invitation in Moroni

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to ask God with a sincere
heart, with real intent

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and faith in Christ, if
the Book of Mormon is true.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But he did not immediately get
the promised spiritual answer.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:84%
However, one day he was deep in
thought, driving down the road.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:84%
The Spirit testified
to him of the truth

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.650 align:middle line:90%
of the Book of Mormon.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So happy and overwhelmed was
he that he rolled down the car

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
window and yelled to
no one in particular

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and yet to all the
world, "It's true!"

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether our testimony
of the Book of Mormon

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:84%
comes the first time we open
it or over a period of time,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.070 align:middle line:84%
it will influence
us all of our days

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
if we continue to read it
and apply its teachings.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.430 align:middle line:84%
President Ezra Taft Benson
taught: "There is ...

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:84%
power in the book which will
begin to flow into your lives

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
the moment you begin a serious
study of the Book of Mormon.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You will find greater
power to resist temptation.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You will find the power
to avoid deception.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:84%
You will find the power to stay
on the strait and narrow path."

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I encourage everyone receiving
this message, including

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the Aaronic Priesthood bearers
convened in this meeting

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:84%
tonight, to discover the
power of the Book of Mormon.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.730 align:middle line:84%
As President Thomas S.
Monson has encouraged:

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
"Read the Book of Mormon.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Ponder its teachings.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Ask Heavenly Father
if it is true."

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:middle line:84%
During that process you
will feel the Spirit of God

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in your lives.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
That Spirit will be
part of your testimony

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that the Book of Mormon is
true, that Joseph Smith was

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
a prophet of God, and
that The Church of Jesus

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Christ of Latter-day Saints is
God's true Church on the earth

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:84%
That testimony will help
you resist temptation.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.090 align:middle line:84%
It will prepare you for "the
great call of diligence ...

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to labor in the
vineyards of the Lord."

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It will stand as a sure anchor
when accusations or slanderous

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.090 align:middle line:84%
statements are used to
challenge your faith and will be

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:84%
a rock-solid foundation when you
are challenged with questions

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
you cannot answer,
at least immediately.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to
discern truth from error,

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and you will feel the
assurance of the Holy Ghost

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
reconfirming your testimony
over and over again

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.440 align:middle line:84%
as you continue to
read the Book of Mormon

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout your lives.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I also encourage the
parents hearing or reading

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.770 align:middle line:84%
this message to make
the Book of Mormon

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:90%
an important part of your home.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.860 align:middle line:84%
As our children were growing,
we read from the Book of Mormon

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:90%
as we ate breakfast.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the bookmark
that we used.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:84%
On the front is a quote from
President Benson promising

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that God would pour
out a blessing upon us

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.570 align:middle line:90%
as we read the Book of Mormon.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:84%
On the back is this promise
from President Marion

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:84%
G. Romney, formerly a counselor
in the First Presidency:

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:84%
"I feel certain that
if, in our homes,

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:84%
parents will read from
the Book of Mormon

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
prayerfully and regularly,
both by themselves

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and with their children, the
spirit of that great book

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
will come to permeate our homes
and all who dwell therein.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:90%
...

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of
contention will depart.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Parents will counsel
their children

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:90%
in greater love and wisdom.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Children will be more
responsive and submissive

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to the counsel of their parents.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Righteousness will increase.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Faith, hope, and charity--the
pure love of Christ--will

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
abound in our homes and lives,
bringing in their wake peace,

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:90%
joy, and happiness."

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, many years after our
children have left home

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and are raising
their own families,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.620 align:middle line:84%
we can see clearly
the fulfillment

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of President Romney's promise.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Our family is far
from perfect, but we

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:84%
can testify of the power
of the Book of Mormon

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and the blessings that reading
it has brought and continues

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to bring into the lives
of our whole family.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The greatest power
of the Book of Mormon

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is its impact in bringing
us closer to Jesus Christ.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a strong witness of Him
and His redeeming mission.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Through it we come to
understand the majesty

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and power of His Atonement.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It teaches His doctrine clearly.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
magnificent chapters

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:84%
describing the visit of the
risen Christ to the Nephites,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:84%
we see and experience Him
loving, blessing, and teaching

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:84%
those people and
come to understand

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that He will do the
same for us if we come

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:90%
to Him by living His gospel.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, I testify of the
power in the Book of Mormon.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Whether reading it in
English, Italian, or French,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.370 align:middle line:84%
in print or on an
electronic device,

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I have found the
same wonderful spirit

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:84%
flowing from its chapters
and verses into my life.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I testify of its ability to
draw us closer to Christ.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
In the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:90%

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
On a signal from the
conductor, the congregation

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
will stand and join the choir
in singing "Now Let Us Rejoice."

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Following the singing, we will
hear from President Dieter F.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Uchtdorf, Second Counselor
in the First Presidency.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It will then be my
privilege to address you.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:42:17.800 align:middle line:90%

00:42:17.800 --> 00:44:30.630 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC PLAYING - "NOW LET US
REJOICE"]

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful hymn.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:90%

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Among the most unforgettable
characters in scripture

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.280 align:middle line:90%
is Alma the Younger.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Though he was the son
of a great prophet,

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.680 align:middle line:84%
he lost his way for
a time and became

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.180 align:middle line:84%
a "wicked and an
idolatrous man."

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:84%
For reasons we can only guess,
he actively opposed his father

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and sought to
destroy the Church.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And because of his eloquence
and persuasiveness,

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:90%
he experienced great success.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But Alma's life changed
when an angel of the Lord

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.940 align:middle line:84%
appeared to him and spoke
with a voice of thunder.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:84%
For three days and three nights,
Alma "was racked with eternal

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:90%
torment, ...

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.850 align:middle line:84%
even with the pains
of a damned soul."

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, somehow, a
faint memory brought light

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:84%
to the darkness of his mind--an
eternal truth taught by his

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:84%
father: that Jesus Christ would
come "to atone for the sins

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:90%
of the world."

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Alma had long ago
rejected such concepts,

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:84%
but now his "mind caught
hold upon this thought,"

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and he humbly, earnestly
placed his trust

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:90%
in Christ's atoning power.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:84%
When Alma emerged
from this experience,

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:90%
he was a changed man.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on,
he devoted his life

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to undoing the
damage he had caused.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He is a powerful
example of repentance,

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, and
enduring faithfulness.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Alma was eventually chosen
to succeed his father

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:90%
as head of the Church of God.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Every citizen of
the Nephite nation

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.190 align:middle line:90%
must have known Alma's story.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The Twitters, Instagrams,
and Facebooks of his day

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:48.410 align:middle line:84%
would have been filled with
images and stories about him.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:84%
He probably appeared regularly
on the cover of the Zarahemla

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Weekly and was the subject
of editorials and network

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:90%
specials.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:84%
In short, he was perhaps the
most well-known celebrity

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of his day.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But when Alma saw that his
people were forgetting God

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and lifting themselves up in
pride and contention--that

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:28.800 align:middle line:84%
sounds almost like our times--he
chose to resign from public

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.410 align:middle line:84%
office and dedicate himself
"wholly to the high priesthood

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of the holy order of God,"
preaching repentance among

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.010 align:middle line:90%
the Nephites.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:44.530 align:middle line:84%
At first, Alma had
great success--that is,

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.150 align:middle line:84%
until he traveled to
the city of Ammonihah.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The people of that
city were well aware

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that Alma was no longer
their political leader,

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and they had little respect
for his priesthood authority.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:05.810 align:middle line:84%
They reviled him, ridiculed him,
and cast him out of their city.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Heartbroken, Alma turned his
back on the city Ammonihah.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:90%
But an angel told him to return.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Just think about it:
he was told to return

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to the people who hated him and
were hostile toward the Church.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It was a dangerous and perhaps
life-threatening assignment.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:90%
But Alma did not hesitate.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
He "returned speedily."

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Alma had been fasting many
days when he entered the city.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.870 align:middle line:84%
There he asked a
complete stranger

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:46.270 align:middle line:84%
if he would "give to an humble
servant of God something

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.920 align:middle line:90%
to eat."

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.420 align:middle line:90%

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.570 align:middle line:90%
This man's name was Amulek.

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Amulek was a well-to-do,
well-known citizen

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.610 align:middle line:90%
of Ammonihah.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Although he came from a
long line of believers,

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:90%
his own faith had grown cold.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He later confessed, "I
was called many times

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and I would not hear; therefore
I knew concerning these things,

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:84%
yet I would not
[believe]; therefore I

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:25.560 align:middle line:90%
went on rebelling against God."

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But God was preparing
Amulek, and when he met Alma,

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
he welcomed the Lord's
servant into his home,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:90%
where Alma stayed for many days.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.820 align:middle line:84%
During that time, Amulek opened
his heart to Alma's message,

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and a marvelous
change came over him.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.560 align:middle line:84%
From then on, Amulek
not only believed;

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.760 align:middle line:90%
he became a champion of truth.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
When Alma went out again
to teach among the people

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of Ammonihah, he had a second
witness at his side--Amulek,

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.420 align:middle line:90%
one of their own.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The events that
followed constitute

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the most bittersweet
narratives in all of scripture.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:84%
You can read about it
in Alma chapters 8-16.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Today I would like to ask you
to consider two questions:

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:27.570 align:middle line:84%
First: "What can I
learn from Alma?"

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Second: "How am I like Amulek?"

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:36.740 align:middle line:90%

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Let me begin by asking
all past, current,

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
or future leaders in the
Church of Jesus Christ,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.800 align:middle line:90%
"What can you learn from Alma?"

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Alma was an exceptionally
gifted and capable man.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:56.110 align:middle line:84%
It may have been easy
to think that he did not

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.060 align:middle line:90%
need anyone's help.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, what did Alma do
when he returned to Ammonihah?

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Alma found Amulek and
asked him for help.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And Alma received help.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.200 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
sometimes we as leaders

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.560 align:middle line:84%
are reluctant to find
and ask our Amuleks.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we think that we can do
the work better by ourselves,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.590 align:middle line:84%
or we are reluctant to
inconvenience others,

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.060 align:middle line:84%
or we assume that others
would not want to participate.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Too often we hesitate
to invite people

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to use their God-given
talents and engage

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.370 align:middle line:90%
in the great work of salvation.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Think of the Savior--did He
begin to establish His Church

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.370 align:middle line:90%
all alone?

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:57.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:90%
His message was not "Stand back.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll handle this."

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it was
"Come, follow me."

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
He inspired, invited,
instructed, and then

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:84%
trusted His followers
to "do the things which

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.300 align:middle line:90%
ye have seen me do."

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
In this way, Jesus Christ built
up not only His Church but also

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:90%
His servants.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In whatever position you
currently serve--whether you

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.380 align:middle line:84%
are a deacons quorum
president, a stake president,

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.710 align:middle line:84%
or an Area President--to
be successful,

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:48.640 align:middle line:90%
you must find your Amuleks.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It may be someone who is
unassuming or even invisible

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.570 align:middle line:90%
within your congregations.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It may be someone who seems
unwilling or unable to serve.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Your Amuleks may be young
or old, men or women,

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.510 align:middle line:84%
inexperienced, tired, or
not active in the Church.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But what may not be
seen at first sight

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.070 align:middle line:84%
is that they are
hoping to hear from you

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.510 align:middle line:90%
the words, "The Lord needs you!

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I need you!"

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Deep down, many want
to serve their God.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:84%
They want to be an
instrument in His hands.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They want to thrust
in their sickle

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and strive with their
might to prepare the earth

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.520 align:middle line:90%
for the return of our Savior.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.680 align:middle line:90%
They want to build His Church.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.570 align:middle line:90%
But they are reluctant to begin.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Often they wait to be asked.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to think of those
in your branches and wards,

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:84%
in your missions and stakes, who
need to hear a call to action.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The Lord has been working
with them--preparing them,

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.320 align:middle line:90%
softening their hearts.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Find them by seeing
with your heart.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Reach out to them.

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Teach them.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Inspire them.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Ask them.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Share with them the words
of the angel to Amulek--that

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the blessing of the Lord shall
rest upon them and their house.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:84%
You may be surprised to discover
a valiant servant of the Lord

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.170 align:middle line:84%
who otherwise would
have remained hidden.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.750 align:middle line:90%

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.890 align:middle line:84%
While some of us should
be looking for an Amulek,

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:46.690 align:middle line:84%
for others the question might
be "How am I like Amulek?"

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you have,
over the years,

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.740 align:middle line:84%
become less committed
in your discipleship.

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the fire of your
testimony has dimmed.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you have
distanced yourself

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.120 align:middle line:90%
from the body of Christ.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you have become
disillusioned or even angry.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Like some of the ancient
Church of Ephesus,

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:16.320 align:middle line:84%
you may have left your
"first love"--the sublime,

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:22.090 align:middle line:84%
eternal truths of the
gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, like Amulek,
you know in your heart

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that the Lord has "called [you]
many times," but you "would not

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:90%
hear."

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, the Lord sees in
you what He saw in Amulek--the

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:84%
potential of a valiant servant
with an important work to do

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and with a testimony to share.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:84%
There is service
that no one else

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.720 align:middle line:90%
can give in quite the same way.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
The Lord has trusted you
with His holy priesthood,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:56:01.720 align:middle line:84%
which holds the divine potential
to bless and lift others.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Listen with your
heart and follow

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:90%
the promptings of the Spirit.

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.790 align:middle line:90%

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I was touched by the journey of
one brother who asked himself,

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:20.860 align:middle line:84%
"When the Lord
calls, will I hear?"

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I will call this
fine brother David.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:84%
David converted to the
Church some 30 years ago.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.640 align:middle line:84%
He served a mission and
then attended law school.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
While he was
studying and working

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to support a young family, he
came across some information

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:42.160 align:middle line:84%
about the Church
that confused him.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The more he read these negative
materials, the more unsettled

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.810 align:middle line:90%
he became.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Eventually he asked to
have his name removed

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.550 align:middle line:90%
from the records of the Church.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:57:01.020 align:middle line:84%
From that time on, like
Alma in his rebellious days,

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:04.520 align:middle line:84%
David spent a great
deal of time debating

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.930 align:middle line:84%
with members of the
Church, engaging

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.700 align:middle line:84%
in online conversations
with the purpose

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:15.540 align:middle line:90%
of challenging their beliefs.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:20.510 align:middle line:90%
He was very good at this.

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:25.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the members he debated
with I will call Jacob.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Jacob was always kind
and respectful to David,

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:34.920 align:middle line:84%
but he was also firm in
his defense of the Church.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, David and Jacob
developed a mutual respect

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and friendship.

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:43.280 align:middle line:84%
What David did not know is that
Jacob was praying for David

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and did so faithfully
for more than a decade.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.490 align:middle line:84%
He even placed his
friend's name for prayer

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:56.750 align:middle line:84%
in the temples of the Lord and
hoped that David's heart would

00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:90%
be softened.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Over time, slowly,
David did change.

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:08.690 align:middle line:84%
He began to remember
with fondness

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
experiences he once had,

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and he remembered the
happiness he had felt when

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:19.850 align:middle line:90%
he was a member of the Church.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Like Alma, David
had not completely

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.890 align:middle line:84%
forgotten the gospel truth
he had once embraced.

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And like Amulek, David felt
the Lord reaching out to him.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:40.610 align:middle line:84%
David was now a partner in a
law firm--a prestigious job.

00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:45.650 align:middle line:84%
He had developed a reputation
as a critic of the Church,

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and he had too much pride
to ask to be readmitted.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:59:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, he continued to
feel the pull of the Shepherd.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.520 align:middle line:84%
He took to heart the scripture
"If any of you lack wisdom,

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.740 align:middle line:84%
let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally,

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and upbraideth not; and
it shall be given him."

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:19.680 align:middle line:84%
He prayed, "Dear God, I want
to be a Latter-day Saint again,

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:84%
but I have questions
that need answers."

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.080 align:middle line:84%
He began to listen to the
whisperings of the Spirit

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and to inspired
answers of friends,

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.610 align:middle line:90%
as he never had before.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:38.580 align:middle line:84%
One after another, his
doubts turned to faith

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:43.200 align:middle line:84%
until finally he realized
that, once again, he

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:50.270 align:middle line:84%
could feel a testimony of Jesus
Christ and His restored Church.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:52.970 align:middle line:84%
At that point, he
knew that he would

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:59.970 align:middle line:84%
be able to overcome his pride
and do whatever it took to be

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:03.650 align:middle line:90%
accepted back into the Church.

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, David entered
the waters of baptism

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and then began counting
down the days until he could

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.680 align:middle line:90%
have his blessings restored.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I am happy to report that this
past summer, David's blessings

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.760 align:middle line:90%
were restored to him.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
He is again fully
participating in the Church

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and serving as a Gospel
Doctrine teacher in his ward.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
He takes every
opportunity to speak

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to others about
his transformation,

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to heal the damage he
caused, and to bear

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:46.550 align:middle line:84%
testimony of the gospel and
the Church of Jesus Christ.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
My dear brothers, my dear
friends, let us seek out,

01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
find, inspire, and
rely upon the Amuleks

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in our wards and stakes.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many Amuleks
in the Church today.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps you know one.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps you are one.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.530 align:middle line:90%

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the Lord has
been whispering to you,

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
urging you to return
to your first love,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
contribute your
talents, and worthily

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
exercise the priesthood
and serve side

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
by side with your fellow
Saints in drawing closer

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus Christ and building the
kingdom of God here on earth.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Our beloved Savior
knows where you are.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.350 align:middle line:90%
He knows your heart.

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
He wants to rescue you.

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.580 align:middle line:90%
He will reach out to you.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Just open your heart to Him.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It is my hope that those who
have strayed from the path

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of discipleship--even by only
a few degrees--will contemplate

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
the goodness and grace of
God, see with their hearts,

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
learn from Alma and Amulek, and
hear the life-changing words

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Savior:
"Come, follow me."

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I urge you to heed His
call, for surely you will

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
receive the harvest of heaven.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The blessings of the Lord will
rest upon you and your house.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Of this I testify and
leave you my blessing

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
as an Apostle of the Lord, in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:05.460 align:middle line:90%

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel blessed to
be in this meeting

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
with those who hold
the priesthood of God.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The devotion, the faith,
and the selfless service

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of this body of men and
boys are a modern miracle.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I speak tonight to priesthood
holders, old and young,

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
united in wholehearted service
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The Lord grants
His power to those

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in all priesthood offices
who worthily serve

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in their priesthood duties.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Wilford Woodruff, as
President of the Church,

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
described his experience in
the offices of the priesthood:

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
"I heard the first sermon I
ever heard in this Church.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%
The next day I was baptized. ...

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I was ordained a Teacher.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
My mission immediately
commenced. ...

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I went through that whole
mission as a Teacher. ...

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
At the conference I was
ordained a Priest. ...

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
After I was ordained a
Priest I was sent ...

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
on [another] mission to
the southern country.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:29.290 align:middle line:90%
That was in the fall of 1834.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I had a companion with
me, and we started out

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.280 align:middle line:90%
without purse and scrip.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I traveled alone a good many
miles and preached the Gospel,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and I baptized a number
that I could not confirm

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Church, because
I was only a Priest. ...

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I traveled some time
preaching the Gospel before I

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.300 align:middle line:90%
was ordained an Elder."

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said, "I have been
some fifty-four years a member

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Twelve Apostles.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I have traveled with
that and other quorums

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
now for sixty years."

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to say: "I
want to say to this assembly

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that I was just as much
sustained by the power of God

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
while holding the
office of a Teacher,

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and especially while officiating
in the vineyard as a Priest,

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:33.880 align:middle line:90%
as I ever was as an Apostle.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
There is no difference in this
so long as we do our duty."

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
That wonderful spiritual
possibility of no difference

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is suggested in the Lord's
description of the Aaronic

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Priesthood as an "appendage"
of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The word appendage means
the two are connected.

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
This connection is important
to the priesthood becoming

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
the force and the blessing
it can be, in this world

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and forever, for it
"is without beginning

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of days or end of years."

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
The connection is a simple one.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The Aaronic Priesthood
prepares young men

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
for an even more sacred trust.

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
"The power and
authority of the higher,

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
or Melchizedek
Priesthood, is to hold

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the keys of all the spiritual
blessings of the church--

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
"To have the
privilege of receiving

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to have the heavens
opened unto them,

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to commune with the
general assembly

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and church of the Firstborn,
and to enjoy the communion

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and presence of God the
Father, and Jesus the mediator

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.900 align:middle line:90%
of the new covenant."

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Those priesthood keys
are fully exercised

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
by only one man at a time,
the President and presiding

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
high priest of
the Lord's Church.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Then, by the
President's delegation,

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
every man who holds the
Melchizedek Priesthood

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
can be endowed with
authority and the privilege

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of speaking and acting in
the name of the Almighty.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.860 align:middle line:90%
There is infinity to that power.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It is concerned
with life and death,

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
with family and the Church, with
the great nature of God Himself

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and His eternal work.

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
The Lord is preparing the
Aaronic Priesthood holder

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to become an elder
serving with faith, power,

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude in that glorious
Melchizedek Priesthood.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
For elders, deep
gratitude will be

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
essential to playing your part
in full priesthood service.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You will remember your days as a
deacon, teacher, or priest when

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
those who held the
higher priesthood

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
reached back to lift
and encourage you

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:13.550 align:middle line:90%
in your priesthood journey.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Every holder of the Melchizedek
Priesthood has such memories,

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
but the sense of gratitude may
have diminished with the years.

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
My hope tonight is to
rekindle that feeling

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and with it a determination
to give all you can

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:35.920 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of help
you once received.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember a bishop
who treated me

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
as if I was already
what I had the potential

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.740 align:middle line:90%
to become in priesthood power.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
He called me one Sunday
when I was a priest.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
He said he needed me
to be his companion

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
to visit some
members of our ward.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
He made it sound as if I was
his only hope for success.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.270 align:middle line:90%
He didn't need me.

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
He had excellent counselors
in his bishopric.

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But we visited a penniless
and hungry widow.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to help
him reach her heart,

01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
challenge her to make
and use a budget,

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and promise her
that she could rise

01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to be in a position not
only to take care of herself

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.530 align:middle line:90%
but to help others.

01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
We went to comfort, next,
two little girls living

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
in a difficult situation.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
As we walked away, the
bishop said quietly to me,

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
"Those children will never
forget that we came to them."

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
At the next house, I saw how
to invite a less-active man

01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to come back to the
Lord by convincing him

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:48.040 align:middle line:90%
the ward members needed him.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
That bishop was a
Melchizedek Priesthood holder

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
who was raising my sights and
giving me a boost by example.

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
He taught me to have the
power and the courage

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to go anywhere in
service for the Lord.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
He is long gone to his reward,
but I still remember him

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
because he reached
down to lift me up

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
when I was an inexperienced
Aaronic Priesthood holder.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I learned later that he saw
in me a future priesthood path

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of greater responsibilities,
then beyond my own vision.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
My father did the
same thing for me.

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
He was a seasoned
and wise holder

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Once he was asked by an
Apostle to write a short note

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
about the scientific evidence
for the age of the earth.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
He wrote it carefully,
knowing that some

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
who might read it had strong
feelings that the earth was

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
much younger than the
scientific evidence suggested.

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I still remember my father
handing me what he had written

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and saying to me, "Hal, you
have the spiritual wisdom

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
to know if I should send this
to the apostles and prophets."

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember much
of what the paper said,

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
but I will carry with
me forever the gratitude

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I felt for a great
Melchizedek Priesthood

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
holder who saw in me spiritual
wisdom that I could not see.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
One night, some
years later, after I

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
had been ordained an
Apostle, I was in Japan

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.570 align:middle line:90%
with the prophet of God.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
He called me on
the phone and asked

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
me to read something
that had been

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
written about Church doctrine.

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
He had spent the night reading
the chapters of a book.

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
He said with a chuckle, "I
can't get through all of this.

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be resting
while I'm working."

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he used
almost the same words

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
my father had years
before: "Hal, you are

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.450 align:middle line:90%
the one who should read this.

01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
You will know if it is
right to publish it."

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That same pattern of a
Melchizedek Priesthood holder

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
raising sights and
giving confidence

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
came one night at
a speech festival

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.580 align:middle line:90%
sponsored by the Church.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I was 17 years of age.

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to speak
to a large audience.

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
was expected of me.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't given a
subject, and so I

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
prepared a talk that
was way beyond what I

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
knew about the gospel.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
As I spoke, I had
a sinking feeling.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I realized I had made a mistake.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I can still remember,
after I spoke,

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:34.430 align:middle line:90%
my feeling of having failed.

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The next and final speaker
was Elder Matthew Cowley

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
He was a great orator--beloved
across the Church.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I still remember sitting
there next to him,

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.990 align:middle line:90%
looking up at him from my seat.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.050 align:middle line:90%
As he stood at the rostrum,

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.350 align:middle line:90%
he began in a powerful voice.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
He said that my speech
had made him feel that he

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.410 align:middle line:90%
was at a great conference.

01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%
He smiled as he said it.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
My feelings of failure left
and were followed by confidence

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that I might someday become
what he seemed to think I

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.970 align:middle line:90%
already was.

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
The memory of that
night still leads

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
me to listen carefully
when an Aaronic Priesthood

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:20.070 align:middle line:90%
holder speaks.

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because of what Elder
Cowley did for me,

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I always expect that I
will hear the word of God.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I am seldom disappointed
and often amazed,

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and I can't help but
smile, as Elder Cowley did.

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Many things may help
strengthen our younger brothers

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to rise up in the
priesthood, but nothing

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
will be more powerful than our
helping them develop the faith

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and confidence that they
can draw on the power of God

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:51.880 align:middle line:90%
in their priesthood service.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
That faith and confidence
won't stay with them

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
from a single
experience of being

01:13:56.230 --> 01:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
lifted by even the most gifted
Melchizedek Priesthood holder.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The ability to draw
on those powers

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
must be cultivated by many
expressions of confidence

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
from those who are more
experienced in the priesthood.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The Aaronic Priesthood holders
will also need daily and even

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
hourly encouragement and
correction from the Lord

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Himself through the Holy Ghost.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
That will be available
to them as they

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.940 align:middle line:90%
choose to remain worthy of it.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It will depend upon the
choices they will make.

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
That is why we must teach
by example and by testimony

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that the words of the great
Melchizedek Priesthood leader

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
King Benjamin are true.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They are the words
of love spoken

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.380 align:middle line:84%
in the name of the Lord,
whose priesthood this is.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
King Benjamin teaches
what is required of us

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to remain pure enough to
receive the encouragement

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and correction of the Lord:

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
"And finally, I cannot tell you
all the things whereby ye may

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
commit sin; for there are
divers ways and means,

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
even so many that I
cannot number them.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
"But this much I can tell
you," said King Benjamin,

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
"that if ye do not watch
yourselves, and your thoughts,

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and your words, and
your deeds, and observe

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
the commandments of God, and
continue in the faith of what

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
ye have heard concerning
the coming of our Lord,

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
even unto the end of your
lives, ye must perish.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, O man, remember,
and perish not."

01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We all are aware
of the fiery darts

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of the enemy of
righteousness being

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
sent like a terrible wind
against the young priesthood

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:42.370 align:middle line:90%
holders we love so much.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
To us they seem like the
stripling warriors, who called

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
themselves the sons of Helaman.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They can survive, like
those young warriors did,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
if they keep themselves safe, as
King Benjamin urged them to do.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The sons of Helaman
did not doubt.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They fought bravely
and came off conquerors

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
because they believed the
words of their mothers.

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We understand the power of
the faith of a loving mother.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Mothers provide that great
support to their sons today.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But we holders of the
priesthood can and must

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
add to that support
with our determination

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to answer the charge
that as we are converted,

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
we are to reach down to
strengthen our brethren.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
My prayer is that every
Melchizedek Priesthood

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
holder will accept the
opportunity offered

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.710 align:middle line:90%
by the Lord:

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
"And if any man among you
be strong in the Spirit,

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
let him take with
him him that is weak,

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that he may be edified
in all meekness,

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.080 align:middle line:90%
that he may become strong also.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
"Therefore, take
with you those who

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
are ordained unto the
lesser priesthood,

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and send them before you
to make appointments,

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and to prepare the way,
and to fill appointments

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that you yourselves
are not able to fill.

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
"Behold, this is the way that
mine apostles, in ancient days,

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:17.210 align:middle line:90%
built up my church unto me."

01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
You priesthood leaders and
fathers of Aaronic Priesthood

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.340 align:middle line:90%
holders can work miracles.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
You can help the Lord fill
the ranks of faithful elders

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
with young men who accept
the call to preach the gospel

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and do it with confidence.

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You will see many
you have lifted

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and encouraged stay faithful,
marry worthily in the temple,

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and in turn lift
and prepare others.

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It will not take new activity
programs, improved teaching

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
materials, or
better social media.

01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
It will not require any call
beyond what you have now.

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The oath and covenant
of the priesthood

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
gives you power,
authority, and direction.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I pray you will go home
and study carefully

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
the oath and covenant of the
priesthood, found in Doctrine

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and Covenants section 84.

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:14.140 align:middle line:84%
All of us hope
that more young men

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
will have experiences
like Wilford Woodruff, who

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
as an Aaronic Priesthood holder
taught the gospel of Jesus

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Christ with converting power.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I pray that we will
rise to our call

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to lift others to prepare them
for their glorious service.

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I thank with all my heart
the wonderful people

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
who have lifted me and shown
me how to love and lift others.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I testify that
President Thomas S.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Monson holds all the keys
of the priesthood on earth

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:48.930 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I bear witness that he,
over a lifetime of service,

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.600 align:middle line:84%
has been an example
for us all of reaching

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.790 align:middle line:84%
to lift others as a holder of
the Melchizedek Priesthood.

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I am personally grateful for the
way he has lifted me and shown

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
me how to lift others.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.840 align:middle line:90%
God the Father lives.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is the Christ.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.060 align:middle line:90%
This is His Church and kingdom.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
This is His priesthood.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I know this for myself by
the power of the Holy Ghost.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, amen.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.140 align:middle line:90%

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, we are grateful for
your attendance this evening.

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
We likewise thank the
Melchizedek Priesthood choir

01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
for the inspiring music they
have provided and acknowledge

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
all those who have assisted in
preparing for these proceedings

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:50.160 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The concluding speaker
for this session

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
will be our beloved prophet,
President Thomas S. Monson.

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Following President
Monson's remarks,

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
the choir will
close this meeting

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
by singing "You Can Make
the Pathway Bright."

01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:13.020 align:middle line:84%
The benediction will then
be offered by Elder Bruce D.

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Porter of the Seventy.

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:33.070 align:middle line:90%

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, brethren, I
pray for the guidance

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
of our Heavenly Father as I
share my message with you.

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:46.750 align:middle line:84%
In 1833 the Lord revealed
to the Prophet Joseph Smith

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.970 align:middle line:90%
a plan for healthy living.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
That plan is found in the
89th section of the Doctrine

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and Covenants and is known
as the Word of Wisdom.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It gives specific direction
regarding the food we eat,

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and it prohibits the
use of substances which

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.370 align:middle line:90%
are harmful to our bodies.

01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Those who are obedient to
the Lord's commandments

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and who faithfully
observe the Word of Wisdom

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
are promised
particular blessings,

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
among which are good health
and added physical stamina.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Recently I read the true account
of a dramatic manifestation

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.770 align:middle line:90%
concerning these promises.

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
A faithful member of the
Church, John A. Larsen,

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
served during World War II in
the United States Coast Guard

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.740 align:middle line:90%
on the ship USS Cambria.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
During a battle in
the Philippines,

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
word came of an approaching
squadron of bombers

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.060 align:middle line:90%
and kamikaze fighter planes.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%

01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Orders were given for
immediate evacuation.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Since the USS Cambria
was already gone,

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:09.000 align:middle line:84%
John and three companions
gathered their gear and hurried

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to the beach, hoping for a lift
out to one of the departing

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.380 align:middle line:90%
ships.

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, a landing
craft picked them up

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and sped toward the last
ship leaving the bay.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
The men on that departing
ship, in an effort

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to evacuate as quickly as
possible, were busy on deck

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and only had time to throw
ropes to the four men,

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
that they might hopefully be
able to climb to the deck.

01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
John, with a heavy radio
strapped to his back,

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
found himself dangling at
the end of a 40-foot rope

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
at the side of a ship
headed out to the open sea.

01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:59.800 align:middle line:84%
He began pulling
himself up, hand over

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.320 align:middle line:84%
hand, knowing that
if he lost his grip,

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
he would almost
certainly perish.

01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
After climbing only
a third of the way,

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:12.850 align:middle line:90%
his arms burned with pain.

01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
He had become so
weak that he felt

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:18.560 align:middle line:90%
he could no longer hold on.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:23.610 align:middle line:84%
With his strength depleted,
as he grimly contemplated his

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
fate, John silently
cried unto God,

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
telling Him that he had always
kept the Word of Wisdom and had

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
lived a clean life--and he now
desperately needed the promise

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and the blessing
of the priesthood.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
John later said that as
he finished his prayer,

01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:58.240 align:middle line:84%
he felt a great
surge of strength.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
He began climbing once again
and fairly flew up the rope.

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
When he reached the deck,
his breathing was normal

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.110 align:middle line:90%
and not the least bit labored.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The blessings of added
health and strength

01:24:10.890 --> 01:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and stamina promised in the
Word of Wisdom had been his.

01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
He gave thanks to
his Heavenly Father

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
then and throughout the
remainder of his life

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
for the answer to his
desperate prayer for help.

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, may we care for
our bodies and our minds

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
by observing the principles set
forth in the Word of Wisdom,

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:40.050 align:middle line:90%
a divinely provided plan.

01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
With all my heart
and soul I testify

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of the glorious blessings
which await us as we do.

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
That this may be so,
I pray in the name

01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:59.700 align:middle line:84%
of our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ the Lord, amen.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:26:05.850 align:middle line:90%

01:26:05.850 --> 01:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC PLAYING - "YOU CAN MAKE
THE PATHWAY BRIGHT"]

01:27:12.120 --> 01:29:17.130 align:middle line:90%

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Our Father in
Heaven, we thank Thee

01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:26.660 align:middle line:84%
for the spirit of fellowship,
peace, and pure truth

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that we have felt at
this priesthood session

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.570 align:middle line:90%
this evening.

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We thank Thee, O
God, for a prophet,

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
even for our beloved
President Thomas S. Monson.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And we thank Thee for
his noble counselors

01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and for the other Brethren
who lead Thy Church, both here

01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:45.350 align:middle line:84%
at the general
level of the Church

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the world,
in every stake, branch,

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and quorum of the Church.

01:29:51.170 --> 01:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
We thank Thee, Father in
Heaven, for the restored gospel

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and for the Prophet
Joseph Smith.

01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
We humbly pray that as we
go forth from this meeting

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
this evening, that
we may go forth

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit of
determination to do Thy will,

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to keep Thy commandments, and
to serve Thee with faithfulness.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We pray that we may return
home to our families,

01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to our loved ones, our
wives and children,

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in a spirit of peace
and love and might ever

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:22.090 align:middle line:90%
manifest it to them.

01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We thank Thee, Father, for
Thy Beloved Son, our Redeemer,

01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:29.230 align:middle line:90%
the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
We pray that we may ever
stand as witnesses of Him

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
at all times, in all
places, and in all things.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:41.350 align:middle line:84%
For these many
blessings we thank Thee,

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and we say these things
humbly in the holy name

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:47.270 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus Christ, amen.

01:30:47.270 --> 01:32:09.340 align:middle line:90%
